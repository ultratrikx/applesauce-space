**High Stakes Notes**


STRATEGEY
- sabotage your oppoenent
  - wait till they get points, and then steal
- take the mogo and keep it with you rather than move to mogo
- multiple arms: for climbing, scoring faster
- spreading rings
- a lot of teams may not go for hang, may be good to hang
- hang can be valuable, esp if other teams focus 
- descoring/devaluing mogo points
